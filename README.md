## Description

This is a multi-level trivia game focusing on fruit. At this point, there are only two levels, but more can be added using many of the functions already in place.

## Level 1

Level 1 is identifying a pictured fruit. When you start the level, a two-minute timer starts counting down. When you click an answer option, the answer screen automatically replaces the question screen, indicating whether you are correct or incorrect. The radio button of your answer is replaced by a check mark or an X depending on whether it is right or wrong. You can then continue to the next question screen by clicking a button. 

When you get to the final screen after answering the question, it will show how many questions you got right and wrong. If the timer ran out, it will also show how many questions were left unanswered. If you answer at least 9 right, you unlock Level 2; if not, you must replay Level 1.

## Level 2

In Level 2, each question provides a list of fruit varieties, and you must identify which fruit comes in those types. You only have ten seconds for each question before the answer is revealed (along with accompanying pictures), which also happens whether you get it right or wrong. You can then continue to the next question via a button. When you reach the final screen, it will again show how many questions you got right, got wrong, or left unanswered. If you got at least 9 right, you unlock the next level (which doesn't exist yet); if not, you must replay Level 2.
